# Performance and Error Handling Verification

## Overview

This document provides verification checklists and procedures for validating the CleanSlate MCP server's performance characteristics and error handling behavior. Since actual CleanSlate API credentials are not available, this includes code review verification and procedures to execute once credentials are obtained.

## Performance Verification

### Response Time Expectations

Per the specification, the CleanSlate MCP server should meet these performance targets:

- **MCP Tool Execution:** < 2 seconds per tool call
- **End-to-End User Experience:** < 5 seconds (including Claude processing time)
- **API Request Timeout:** 10 seconds (configurable via `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- **Retry Delay:** 1 second between retry attempts

### Performance Test Procedures

#### Test P1: log_food Response Time

**Objective:** Measure time from tool invocation to response

**Procedure:**
1. Enable debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in `.env`
2. Log entry: "Log chicken breast with 165 calories and 31g protein"
3. Check server logs for timing information
4. Measure: timestamp of request received → timestamp of response sent

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Tool execution completes in < 2 seconds
- [ ] No unnecessary delays in processing
- [ ] Response returned immediately after API call completes

**Expected Timing Breakdown:**
- Input validation: < 10ms
- API HTTP request: 200-1000ms (depends on API latency)
- Response formatting: < 10ms
- Total: < 2000ms

---

#### Test P2: get_today_log with Multiple Entries

**Objective:** Verify performance scales with entry count

**Procedure:**
1. Log 20 entries
2. Call get_today_log
3. Measure response time

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Response time < 2 seconds even with 20 entries
- [ ] Linear scaling with entry count (no exponential growth)
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable

**Expected Behavior:**
- API response time dominant factor
- Minimal processing overhead in MCP layer
- No pagination needed (today's log unlikely to exceed 100 entries)

---

#### Test P3: get_today_summary Performance

**Objective:** Verify summary calculation efficiency

**Procedure:**
1. Log 15 entries with varying calories/protein
2. Call get_today_summary
3. Measure response time

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Calculation performed by API (not client-side)
- [ ] No redundant API calls

**Expected Behavior:**
- Single API call to `/food-entries/today/summary`
- No client-side calculation loop
- Immediate response formatting

---

#### Test P4: Concurrent Tool Invocations

**Objective:** Verify server handles multiple simultaneous requests

**Procedure:**
1. Use MCP Inspector or script to invoke 3 tools simultaneously:
   - log_food
   - get_today_log
   - get_today_summary
2. Verify all complete successfully

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All requests complete successfully
- [ ] No race conditions or data corruption
- [ ] Response times remain consistent
- [ ] No server crashes or hangs

**Expected Behavior:**
- Independent API calls don't interfere
- Stateless server design handles concurrency
- Node.js event loop manages async operations

---

### Performance Code Review

#### Code Review Checklist: Performance

Review the implementation for performance best practices:

- [x] Uses native `fetch` API (no heavy HTTP client library)
- [x] Request timeout configured (default 10 seconds)
- [x] Retry logic limited (max 1 retry to avoid cascading delays)
- [x] No blocking synchronous operations
- [x] Efficient error handling (doesn't re-throw unnecessarily)

**Tool Implementations (`src/tools/*.ts`):**
- [x] Zod validation performs fast schema checks
- [x] No unnecessary data transformations
- [x] Minimal object copying
- [x] Direct pass-through of API responses (no complex mapping)

**Date Utilities (`src/utils/date.ts`):**
- [x] Uses native `Date` object (no heavy date libraries)
- [x] Simple ISO string formatting

- [x] No caching implemented (Phase 1 - future optimization)
- [x] No database queries (all data from CleanSlate API)
- [x] Minimal dependencies (only MCP SDK and Zod)

**Potential Performance Issues Identified:** None

## Error Message Quality Review

### Judgment-Free Messaging Audit

Review all user-facing error messages for compliance with CleanSlate's anti-perfectionism philosophy:

#### Authentication Errors
- [x] "Invalid API key. Check your CLEANSLATE_API_KEY configuration."
  - Clear, actionable, no blame

#### Validation Errors
- [x] "Food name is required"
  - Direct, no judgment
- [x] "Calories must be between 0 and 10000"
  - Specific constraint, no blame
- [x] "Protein must be between 0 and 500 grams"
  - Specific, includes unit
- [x] "Entry ID must be a valid identifier"
  - Avoids technical jargon ("UUID")
- [x] "Provide at least one field to update (calories, protein, or name)"
  - Helpful suggestion

#### Not Found Errors
- [x] "That entry wasn't found. It may have been deleted."
  - Judgment-free, suggests possibility

#### API Errors
- [x] "Couldn't save entry right now. Try again in a moment."
  - Encouraging, suggests retry
- [x] "Couldn't complete request right now. Try again in a moment."
  - Generic but judgment-free

#### Network Errors
- [x] "Network issue. Check your connection and try again."
  - Clear problem, actionable suggestion

### Forbidden Phrases Audit

Verify no error messages contain these judgmental phrases:

- [ ] "invalid" (without helpful context) - ✅ Not found
- [ ] "failed" (without suggesting next step) - ✅ Not found
- [ ] "error" (without explanation) - ✅ Not found
- [ ] "you entered" (blame-oriented) - ✅ Not found
- [ ] "user error" (blame-oriented) - ✅ Not found
- [ ] "bad request" (technical jargon) - ✅ Not found
- [ ] "internal server error" (technical jargon) - ✅ Not found

### Encouraging Language Audit

Verify error messages maintain encouraging tone:

- [x] Suggests retry: "Try again in a moment"
- [x] Explains possibility: "It may have been deleted"
- [x] Provides specific guidance: "Check your CLEANSLATE_API_KEY"
- [x] Maintains calm tone: "Couldn't complete" vs "Failed"
- [x] Avoids SHOUTING (all caps): No ALL CAPS found

## Performance Optimization Opportunities (Future)

### Phase 2 Optimizations (Not Required for Phase 1)

These are identified optimization opportunities for future implementation:

1. **In-Memory Caching**
   - Cache today's log for repeated get_today_log calls
   - Cache summary for repeated get_today_summary calls
   - Invalidate cache on log_food, edit_food_entry, delete_food_entry
   - Expected improvement: 80-90% latency reduction for repeated reads

2. **Basic Foods Caching**
   - Cache Basic Foods library (Phase 2 feature)
   - Rarely changes, frequently accessed
   - Expected improvement: 95% latency reduction for basic food lookups

3. **Connection Pooling**
   - Native fetch handles this automatically
   - No custom implementation needed

4. **Request Batching**
   - Not applicable for Phase 1 (independent tool calls)
   - Consider for Phase 2 if bulk operations added
