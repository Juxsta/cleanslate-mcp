# Task Group 1: Project Foundation & Setup

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 1 (TASK-001 through TASK-007) from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-20-cleanslate-mcp-init/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Initialize the Node.js project with proper tooling, configuration, and project structure. This establishes the foundation for the CleanSlate MCP Server, including package management, TypeScript configuration, code quality tools, testing framework, project directories, environment configuration, and licensing.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully initialized a production-ready Node.js/TypeScript project using pnpm as the package manager. The implementation establishes a complete development environment with strict TypeScript configuration, automated code quality tools (ESLint and Prettier), comprehensive testing infrastructure (Vitest with 80% coverage thresholds), and proper project documentation following CleanSlate's anti-perfectionism philosophy.

The project structure follows the MCP server architecture specification with clearly organized directories for source code (api, config, tools, types, utils) and tests (unit and integration). All configuration files enforce modern development practices including ES2022+ targets, strict type checking, and judgment-free error messaging. The Apache 2.0 license and comprehensive README align with CleanSlate's open-source values.

## Key Implementation Details

### TASK-001: Node.js Project Initialization
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/package.json`

Initialized a complete Node.js project with pnpm package manager including:
- Project metadata (cleanslate-mcp v0.1.0)
- Core dependencies: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.20.1, zod v3.25.76
- Development dependencies: typescript v5.9.3, vitest v1.6.1, eslint v8.57.1, prettier v3.6.2, tsx v4.20.6
- Comprehensive npm scripts: build, dev, start, test, test:watch, test:coverage, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, typecheck
- Engine requirements: Node.js >=18.0.0, pnpm >=8.0.0
- Apache 2.0 license

**Rationale:** pnpm provides faster installations and better disk space efficiency compared to npm/yarn. The chosen dependencies align with the spec's requirement for minimal dependencies while providing essential MCP server functionality (SDK), runtime validation (zod), and modern development tooling.

### TASK-002: TypeScript Configuration
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/tsconfig.json`

Configured TypeScript with strict mode enabled:
- Target: ES2022 (supports native fetch API)
- Module: ESNext with "bundler" resolution
- Strict mode: All strict type-checking options enabled
- Additional strictness: noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters, noImplicitReturns, noUncheckedIndexedAccess
- Output: dist/ directory with source maps and declaration files
- Include patterns: src/** (source code only)

**Rationale:** Strict TypeScript configuration prevents common runtime errors and improves code quality. ES2022 target enables modern JavaScript features including native fetch (avoiding external HTTP client dependencies). Bundler module resolution works well with modern build tools.

### TASK-003: ESLint and Prettier Configuration
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`

Configured code quality tools:
- ESLint with @typescript-eslint/recommended rules
- Explicit ban on `any` types (enforced as error)
- Prettier with 100-character line width, single quotes, semicolons
- Integration between ESLint and Prettier (no conflicts)

**Rationale:** ESLint catches code quality issues and potential bugs. Prettier ensures consistent formatting across the codebase. The strict "no any" rule aligns with the spec requirement for "no any types in production code."

### TASK-004: Vitest Testing Framework
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/vitest.config.ts`

Configured Vitest as the test framework:
- Coverage provider: v8 (fast, native V8 coverage)
- Coverage thresholds: 80% for lines, functions, branches, statements
- Test patterns: **/*.test.ts, **/*.spec.ts
- Coverage output: text, json, and html formats
- Exclusions: node_modules, dist, coverage, test files, type definitions

**Rationale:** Vitest is faster than Jest and has native TypeScript support. The 80% coverage threshold balances pragmatism with code quality (anti-perfectionism philosophy). Multiple report formats support different workflows (terminal, CI, browser review).

### TASK-005: Project Structure
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/src/` and `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/tests/`

Created complete directory structure matching spec:
- src/config/ - Environment configuration
- src/tools/ - MCP tool implementations
- src/api/ - CleanSlate API client
- src/types/ - TypeScript interfaces
- src/utils/ - Utility functions
- tests/unit/tools/ - Tool unit tests
- tests/unit/api/ - API client unit tests
- tests/unit/utils/ - Utility unit tests
- tests/integration/ - Integration tests

.gitkeep files added to empty directories to preserve structure in git.

**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easy to navigate. The structure matches the architectural diagram in the spec. Parallel test structure (tests/unit/[component]) makes tests easy to locate.

### TASK-006: Environment Configuration
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/.env.example`, `.gitignore`

Created environment configuration:
- Required: CLEANSLATE_API_KEY (with instructions to get from cleanslate.sh)
- Optional: CLEANSLATE_API_BASE_URL (default: https://api.cleanslate.sh/v1)
- Optional: LOG_LEVEL (default: info)
- Optional: REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS (default: 10000)
- Optional: MAX_RETRIES (default: 1)

Updated .gitignore to exclude:
- .env, .env.local, .env.*.local (prevent committing secrets)
- node_modules, dist, coverage (build artifacts)
- OS files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- IDE files (.vscode, .idea, *.swp)

**Rationale:** Clear documentation of environment variables helps users configure the server. .gitignore prevents accidental commits of secrets and build artifacts. Comments in .env.example explain each variable's purpose.

### TASK-007: License and Documentation
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/LICENSE`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Created documentation structure:
- LICENSE: Apache 2.0 license with CleanSlate copyright (2025)
- README.md: Comprehensive documentation including philosophy, features, installation, Claude Code integration, usage examples, tool reference, troubleshooting, and development guide
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Placeholder for future contribution guidelines

**Rationale:** Apache 2.0 aligns with CleanSlate's open-source philosophy. The comprehensive README provides everything needed to understand, install, and use the MCP server. The philosophy section emphasizes anti-perfectionism and judgment-free approach.

## Database Changes

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Consistent naming: package.json uses kebab-case (cleanslate-mcp), TypeScript uses modern conventions
- Automated formatting: Prettier configured for consistent indentation and code style
- Meaningful names: All configuration files clearly named (.eslintrc.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts)
- Remove dead code: Fresh project with no legacy code or commented blocks
- DRY principle: Configuration centralized in dedicated files (not duplicated)

**Deviations:** None

### Development Conventions
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Consistent project structure: Follows specification exactly with src/, tests/, config/ organization
- Clear documentation: README.md provides comprehensive setup and architecture overview
- Version control: .gitignore configured to exclude secrets, build artifacts, and IDE files
- Environment configuration: All config in environment variables, .env.example template provided
- Dependency management: Minimal dependencies documented in README, pnpm for efficient package management

**Deviations:** None

### Tech Stack Standards

- Linting/Formatting: ESLint and Prettier (industry standards)

**Deviations:** None - project is Node.js/TypeScript (not Rails) but this aligns with the MCP server requirements in the spec.

### Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Not directly applicable at this stage (no business logic implemented yet)
- Foundation prepared: TypeScript strict mode prevents many runtime errors
- Philosophy embedded: README and documentation emphasize judgment-free error messages

**Deviations:** None

### Validation Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Zod dependency installed for runtime validation (to be used in Task-011)
- TypeScript strict mode provides compile-time validation
- Environment variable validation prepared via .env.example documentation

**Deviations:** None

### API Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Not applicable yet (API client not implemented)
- Foundation prepared: src/api/ directory created, native fetch available (Node 18+)

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### MCP SDK
- **Package:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.20.1
- **Purpose:** Core MCP server functionality
- **Integration:** Installed and ready for server setup in Task Group 4

### Development Tools
- **ESLint:** Configured for TypeScript code quality

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None - all tasks completed successfully

### Limitations
1. **CONTRIBUTING.md is placeholder**
   - Description: Full contribution guidelines deferred to Task-045
   - Impact: Low - project not yet ready for external contributions
   - Reason: Prioritizing functional implementation over documentation

2. **No pre-commit hooks**
   - Description: Linting/formatting not enforced automatically on commit
   - Impact: Low - developers can run manually via npm scripts
   - Reason: Not required by spec, can be added later if needed

## Performance Considerations
Not applicable at foundation stage - no runtime code implemented yet.

Configuration choices support performance:
- pnpm for faster package installation
- Vitest for faster test execution than Jest
- TypeScript compilation to dist/ for optimized runtime

## Security Considerations
- .gitignore configured to prevent committing .env files (API key protection)
- Environment variables used for secrets (not hardcoded)
- Dependencies from trusted sources (MCP SDK from official repository)
- Apache 2.0 license permits commercial use while requiring attribution

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This Task Group unblocks ALL subsequent tasks:
- Task Group 2 (TASK-008 to TASK-015): Depends on project structure and TypeScript configuration
- Task Group 3 (TASK-016 to TASK-022): Depends on dependencies (zod, fetch) and structure
- Task Group 4 (TASK-023 to TASK-027): Depends on MCP SDK and TypeScript configuration
- Task Groups 5-8: Depend on all of the above

**Critical Path:** TASK-001, TASK-002, and TASK-005 are critical path tasks that unblock all future work.

## Notes

### Philosophy Alignment
All implementation decisions align with CleanSlate's core values:
- **Anti-perfectionism:** 80% coverage target (not 100%), pragmatic tooling choices
- **Simplicity:** Minimal dependencies (only MCP SDK and zod for production)
- **Speed:** Fast tools (pnpm, Vitest), modern JavaScript features
- **Judgment-free:** README emphasizes compassionate approach, no blame in documentation
- **Open source:** Apache 2.0 license, comprehensive README for contributors

### Development Experience
The foundation provides excellent developer experience:
- Clear project structure (easy to navigate)
- Fast feedback loops (vitest, tsx for watch mode)
- Automated quality checks (eslint, prettier)
- Comprehensive documentation (README covers all use cases)

### Future Improvements
Potential enhancements not required for Phase 1:
- Pre-commit hooks (husky) for automatic linting/formatting
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- VS Code workspace settings for editor integration

### Time Tracking
Estimated: 6-10 hours for Task Group 1
Actual: ~2 hours (many files were pre-existing from prior setup)

The foundation was completed efficiently due to clear specifications and modern tooling that automates much of the setup process.
