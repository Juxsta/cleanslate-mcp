# Task 3: CleanSlate API Client Implementation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 3 (TASK-016 through TASK-022) from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-20-cleanslate-mcp-init/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Build a robust HTTP client for interacting with the CleanSlate API with authentication, error handling, and retry logic. This task group includes API research, client implementation, authentication, error handling, endpoint methods, and comprehensive unit tests.

## Implementation Summary

This implementation provides a complete, type-safe HTTP client for the CleanSlate API using Node.js native fetch. The client handles Bearer token authentication, automatic retry logic for network failures, comprehensive error mapping with judgment-free messages, and timeout management. All CRUD operations for food entries are implemented with proper TypeScript typing.

The implementation follows a layered architecture: a base `CleanSlateClient` class handles low-level HTTP operations, authentication, and error handling, while `CleanSlateApiClient` extends it with high-level endpoint methods. This separation of concerns makes the code maintainable and testable.

Since actual CleanSlate API documentation was not accessible, the implementation is based on standard REST API patterns and assumptions documented in the spec. All endpoint structures, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms follow industry best practices and can be easily adjusted once actual API documentation is available.

## Key Implementation Details

### API Research (TASK-016)
**Location:** `docs/api-research.md`

Conducted thorough research on CleanSlate API structure, but actual API documentation was not directly accessible. Created comprehensive documentation of:
- Assumed base URL: `https://api.cleanslate.sh/v1`
- Bearer token authentication method
- All 5 required endpoints with full request/response specifications
- Error response formats and HTTP status code mappings
- Rate limiting assumptions
- Verification checklist for production deployment

**Rationale:** The spec provided clear endpoint assumptions. Documented these comprehensively with justifications so they can be easily verified and adjusted when actual API docs are available.

### Authentication Handler (TASK-018)
**Location:** `src/api/auth.ts`

Implemented two key functions:
1. `createAuthHeaders()` - Generates Authorization Bearer header from API key
2. `validateApiKey()` - Validates API key format before use

**Rationale:** Separating authentication logic into a dedicated module makes it reusable and testable. Validation happens early (fail-fast principle) to provide clear error messages if API key is missing or malformed.

### Base HTTP Client (TASK-017, TASK-019)
**Location:** `src/api/client.ts`

The `CleanSlateClient` class provides core HTTP functionality:
- **Configuration**: Accepts apiKey, baseUrl, timeout, and maxRetries
- **Request Method**: Central `request()` method handles all HTTP operations
- **Timeout Management**: Uses AbortController to enforce configurable timeout (default 10s)
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed requests with 1-second delay
- **Error Mapping**: Maps HTTP status codes to specific error classes:
  - 401/403 → `AuthenticationError`
  - 400/422 → `ValidationError`
  - 404 → `NotFoundError`
  - 5xx → `ApiError`
  - Network failures → `NetworkError`
- **HTTP Methods**: Protected `get()`, `post()`, `patch()`, `delete()` methods

**Rationale:** Using native fetch (Node 18+) avoids external dependencies. The retry logic only retries network failures and 5xx errors, not client errors (4xx), following best practices. Error mapping provides user-friendly, judgment-free messages as required by CleanSlate's philosophy.

### API Endpoints (TASK-020, TASK-021)
**Location:** `src/api/endpoints.ts`

The `CleanSlateApiClient` extends `CleanSlateClient` with typed methods:
1. **createFoodEntry()** - POST /food-entries
2. **getTodayLog()** - GET /food-entries/today
3. **deleteFoodEntry()** - DELETE /food-entries/:id
4. **updateFoodEntry()** - PATCH /food-entries/:id
5. **getTodaySummary()** - GET /food-entries/today/summary

All methods include comprehensive JSDoc with examples, parameter descriptions, and thrown error types.

**Rationale:** Extending the base client provides a clean inheritance hierarchy. Each method is strongly typed with TypeScript interfaces, providing IDE autocomplete and compile-time type safety. The summary endpoint handles empty logs gracefully (returns zeros, not an error), aligning with the spec requirement.

### Application Constants
**Location:** `src/constants.ts`

Centralized constants for:
- Default API base URL
- Request timeout (10000ms)
- Max retries (1)
- API endpoint paths (using function for parameterized endpoints)
- HTTP status codes

**Rationale:** Constants avoid magic numbers/strings throughout the codebase. The `ENDPOINTS` object uses a function for parameterized paths (`FOOD_ENTRY_BY_ID`), making endpoint URLs type-safe and reusable.

## Database Changes (if applicable)
N/A - This is a headless API client with no local database.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### New Dependencies Added
None - this implementation uses only native Node.js APIs and existing project dependencies (Vitest for testing).

### Configuration Changes
No environment configuration changes in this task group. The client expects `CLEANSLATE_API_KEY` and `CLEANSLATE_API_BASE_URL` environment variables, which will be configured in Task Group 2 (Environment Configuration Loader).

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `tests/unit/api/client.test.ts` - 11 tests covering base client functionality
- `tests/unit/api/endpoints.test.ts` - 8 tests covering all endpoint methods

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (19 total tests)
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Pending (will be covered in Task Group 4 - MCP Server Foundation)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Authentication header inclusion
  - Error mapping for all status codes (401, 400, 404, 500)
  - Retry logic on network failure
  - Successful retry on second attempt
  - Max retries exceeded handling
  - All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
  - Empty responses handling
  - Partial updates (PATCH with subset of fields)

### Manual Testing Performed
- Executed test suite: `pnpm test tests/unit/api`
- Result: ✅ All 19 tests passed
- No manual API testing performed (actual API not yet accessible)

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/api.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The API client follows RESTful design principles with appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PATCH for updates, DELETE for removal). Standard HTTP status codes are used (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500). Endpoint paths follow consistent naming with plural nouns (`/food-entries`). Query parameters would be supported via the base `request()` method for future expansion.

**Deviations:** None. All REST conventions followed.

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
- **Consistent Naming**: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes (`CleanSlateClient`, `CleanSlateApiClient`)
- **Meaningful Names**: Functions like `createAuthHeaders()`, `validateApiKey()`, `createFoodEntry()` are self-documenting
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Each method does one thing (e.g., `get()`, `post()`, `handleResponse()`)
- **DRY Principle**: Common logic (error handling, retry, authentication) centralized in base client
- **No Dead Code**: All code is functional and tested

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
- **User-Friendly Messages**: All error messages are judgment-free and actionable (e.g., "Couldn't complete request right now. Try again in a moment.")
- **Fail Fast**: API key validation happens in constructor before any requests
- **Specific Exception Types**: Custom error classes for each failure scenario (`AuthenticationError`, `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `ApiError`, `NetworkError`)
- **Centralized Error Handling**: All error mapping happens in `handleResponse()` and `handleError()` methods
- **Retry Strategies**: 1-second delay between retries, with max 1 retry attempt
- **Clean Up Resources**: Timeout timers properly cleared in finally-equivalent logic

**Deviations:** None. All error handling best practices followed.

### agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Every file starts with a module-level JSDoc comment explaining its purpose. All public methods include comprehensive JSDoc with parameter descriptions, return types, thrown errors, and usage examples. Complex logic (retry loop, error mapping) includes inline comments explaining the "why" behind decisions.

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
TypeScript interfaces use PascalCase (`FoodEntry`, `CreateFoodEntryRequest`). Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL`, `HTTP_STATUS`). File names use kebab-case (`food-entry.ts`, `api-client.ts`). All imports use `.js` extension for ES modules compatibility.

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Input validation happens at the authentication layer (`validateApiKey()`) before making any requests. The API client relies on Zod validation schemas (implemented in Task Group 2) for business logic validation. Error messages from validation failures are surfaced to users in judgment-free language.

**Deviations:** None. Validation is deferred to higher layers (MCP tools) as appropriate for an HTTP client.

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Tests are organized into logical groups (Authentication, Error Mapping, Retry Logic, HTTP Methods). Each test has a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "should include Authorization Bearer token in request headers"). Mocks are properly reset before each test with `beforeEach()`. Tests verify both success and failure paths. All 19 tests pass consistently.

**Deviations:** None.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
The client provides methods for all 5 CleanSlate API endpoints:

1. **POST /food-entries**
   - Request: `{ name: string, calories: number, protein: number }`
   - Response: `{ entry: FoodEntry }`

2. **GET /food-entries/today**
   - Request: None
   - Response: `{ entries: FoodEntry[] }`

3. **DELETE /food-entries/:id**
   - Request: None
   - Response: `{ success: boolean }`

4. **PATCH /food-entries/:id**
   - Request: `{ name?: string, calories?: number, protein?: number }`
   - Response: `{ entry: FoodEntry }`

5. **GET /food-entries/today/summary**
   - Request: None
   - Response: `{ totalCalories: number, totalProtein: number, entryCount: number }`

### External Services
- **CleanSlate API**: Primary external service. Base URL configurable via environment variable.

### Internal Dependencies
- **Type Definitions**: Depends on `types/food-entry.ts`, `types/api.ts` from Task Group 2
- **Error Classes**: Depends on `utils/errors.ts` from Task Group 2
- **Constants**: Defines `constants.ts` used throughout the application
- **Will be used by**: MCP tools in Task Groups 5 and 6

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None at this time. All tests pass and implementation is complete.

### Limitations

1. **API Documentation Unavailable**
   - Description: Actual CleanSlate API documentation was not accessible during implementation
   - Impact: Endpoint paths, request/response formats, and authentication method are assumed based on spec
   - Reason: Public API documentation not found or requires authentication
   - Future Consideration: Verify all assumptions against actual API docs before production deployment. See `docs/api-research.md` for complete verification checklist.

2. **No Request/Response Logging**
   - Description: Client does not currently log requests/responses for debugging
   - Impact: Harder to troubleshoot API issues in development
   - Reason: Logging framework not yet implemented (deferred to Task Group 4)
   - Future Consideration: Add structured logging in `request()` method once logger is available

3. **Fixed Retry Delay**
   - Description: Retry delay is hardcoded to 1 second (no exponential backoff)
   - Impact: May not be optimal for all failure scenarios
   - Reason: Spec specifies "1 retry with 1-second delay" for simplicity
   - Future Consideration: Implement exponential backoff if rate limiting becomes an issue

## Performance Considerations

- **Timeout**: 10-second default timeout prevents hanging requests
- **Retry Logic**: Single retry with 1-second delay limits impact of transient failures
- **Native Fetch**: Using Node.js native fetch avoids dependency overhead
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript compilation catches errors at build time, not runtime
- **Memory**: No in-memory caching yet (planned for future optimization per spec)

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: API key stored in environment variable, never hardcoded
- **Bearer Token**: Uses standard Authorization Bearer header for authentication
- **HTTPS**: All requests use HTTPS (enforced by base URL)
- **Error Messages**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information (no API keys, tokens in errors)
- **Input Validation**: Validates API key format before use (fail-fast security)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This implementation is a **critical dependency** for:
- **Task Group 4** (MCP Server Foundation) - Server will instantiate API client
- **Task Group 5** (MCP Tools Part 1) - Tools will call API client methods
- **Task Group 6** (MCP Tools Part 2) - Tools will call API client methods

All future tasks that interact with CleanSlate API depend on this client implementation.

## Notes

### API Research Approach
Due to inability to access actual CleanSlate API documentation, I made well-reasoned assumptions based on:
- Spec requirements (5 endpoints, Bearer token auth)
- Standard REST API patterns (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)
- Industry best practices (JSON responses, standard status codes)
- Created comprehensive `docs/api-research.md` with verification checklist

### Test Strategy
Tests use mocked fetch responses to validate client behavior without requiring actual API access. Once API is available:
1. Run integration tests against API sandbox
2. Verify request/response formats match assumptions
3. Adjust types and error handling as needed
4. Update `docs/api-research.md` with actuals

### Error Message Philosophy
All error messages follow CleanSlate's judgment-free philosophy:
- ✅ "Couldn't complete request right now. Try again in a moment."
- ✅ "That entry wasn't found. It may have been deleted."
- ✅ "Invalid API key. Check your CLEANSLATE_API_KEY configuration."
- ❌ Never: "ERROR: Request failed with status 500"
- ❌ Never: "You entered invalid data"

### Code Organization
The layered architecture (base client → endpoint client) provides:
- **Separation of Concerns**: HTTP logic separate from business logic
- **Testability**: Can test retry/timeout logic independently
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new endpoints by extending `CleanSlateApiClient`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with no `any` types

This architecture will scale well as more endpoints are added in Phase 2 (Basic Foods library).
