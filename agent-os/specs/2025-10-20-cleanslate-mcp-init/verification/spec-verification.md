## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy

**Status:** PASS - All user answers accurately captured

**Analysis:**
The requirements.md file comprehensively captures all information from the user conversation:

**User Intent Captured:**
- User's research directive: "Make sure to research cleanslate first, since they have specific ideology when it comes to tracking" - VERIFIED in requirements Philosophy Alignment section
- User's approval: "This looks good. Lets create the spec for first build/project init" - VERIFIED by Phase 1 scope matching roadmap
- CleanSlate philosophy documented: Only calories + protein, daily reset, anti-perfectionism, speed, simplicity - ALL PRESENT
- Technical preferences: TypeScript, Node.js, pnpm, MCP SDK - ALL SPECIFIED
- Open source commitment: Apache 2.0 license - CONFIRMED in requirements
- Integration goal: Claude Code usage - EXPLICITLY STATED
- Scope: Phase 1 from roadmap (Core MCP Server & Simple Logging) - CORRECTLY SCOPED

**Out of Scope Items Properly Documented:**
- Basic Foods library (Phase 2) - CONFIRMED
- Educational curriculum (Phase 3) - CONFIRMED
- Weekly summaries (Phase 4) - CONFIRMED
- Voice optimization (Phase 4) - CONFIRMED
- NPM publishing (Phase 5) - CONFIRMED

**Reusability Opportunities:**
This is a greenfield project, so reusability analysis is not applicable. The requirements correctly note this and identify third-party dependencies to leverage:
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk - DOCUMENTED
- Zod for validation - DOCUMENTED
- Node.js native fetch API - DOCUMENTED

**Verdict:** Requirements.md perfectly reflects the user's stated needs, research findings, and scope decisions.

---

### Check 2: Visual Assets

**Status:** N/A - No visual assets

**Analysis:**
The visuals directory does not exist, which is appropriate for this project. This is a headless MCP server (backend-only) with no UI components. The spec correctly notes in the "Visual Design" section:

> "No UI components required. This is a headless MCP server that exposes tools for conversational AI interaction."

**Verdict:** No visual verification needed for this backend-only project.

---

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking

**Status:** N/A - No visuals exist

This is a backend MCP server with no UI, so visual design tracking is not applicable.

---

### Check 4: Requirements Deep Dive

**Explicit Features Requested:**
1. MCP server that connects to Claude Code - PRESENT in spec
2. CleanSlate API integration - PRESENT with detailed endpoints
3. TypeScript-based with Node.js - PRESENT in tech stack
4. Five core tools: log_food, get_today_log, delete_food_entry, edit_food_entry, get_today_summary - ALL PRESENT with full specifications
5. Only calories and protein tracking (no other macros) - ENFORCED in data models
6. Daily reset philosophy (today-only data) - ENFORCED in all tool designs
7. Judgment-free error messaging - PRESENT with detailed examples
8. 80%+ test coverage - SPECIFIED in testing strategy
9. Apache 2.0 license - SPECIFIED in requirements
10. pnpm package manager - SPECIFIED in tech stack

**Constraints Stated:**
1. TypeScript strict mode required - PRESENT in requirements and config
2. Response time under 2 seconds - PRESENT as NFR
3. No historical guilt-inducing features - ENFORCED by design
4. Speed and simplicity prioritized - REFLECTED throughout
5. Anti-perfectionism in UX - REFLECTED in error handling

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
1. Basic Foods library - CORRECTLY excluded (Phase 2)
2. Educational curriculum - CORRECTLY excluded (Phase 3)
3. Weekly summaries - CORRECTLY excluded (Phase 4)
4. Voice optimization - CORRECTLY excluded (Phase 4)
5. NPM publishing - CORRECTLY excluded (Phase 5)

**Reusability Opportunities:**
Greenfield project - No existing code to reuse. External dependencies properly identified.

**Implicit Needs:**
1. Development workflow documentation - ADDRESSED in spec (setup instructions)
2. Environment variable management - ADDRESSED (comprehensive config section)
3. Error handling for network failures - ADDRESSED (retry logic specified)
4. Logging strategy - ADDRESSED (development vs production approach)
5. Graceful shutdown - ADDRESSED in tasks (SIGINT/SIGTERM)

**Verdict:** Spec comprehensively addresses all explicit features, respects constraints, correctly excludes out-of-scope items, and anticipates implicit developer needs.

---

### Check 5: Core Specification Validation

**Goal Section:**
The goal directly addresses the problem from requirements: "Create a production-ready MCP server that wraps the CleanSlate API, enabling AI assistants like Claude to perform judgment-free nutrition tracking."

This matches the user's stated intent to enable CleanSlate tracking through Claude Code.

**PASS**

---

**User Stories:**
All five user stories trace back to requirements and CleanSlate's philosophy:

1. "As a perfectionism-prone user..." - Directly addresses CleanSlate's anti-perfectionism core value
2. "As a developer in Claude Code..." - Matches user's stated goal of Claude Code integration
3. "As a user who makes mistakes..." - Reflects edit/delete tools from requirements
4. "As a health-conscious user..." - Reflects daily reset philosophy from research
5. "As a CleanSlate user..." - Reflects calories + protein only constraint

**PASS**

---

**Core Requirements:**
All functional requirements trace to user-stated needs:

- MCP server with Claude Code connection - User requested Claude Code integration
- CleanSlate API authentication - Necessary for API integration
- Five core tools - Explicitly listed in requirements
- Today-only operations - From CleanSlate philosophy research
- Zod validation with judgment-free errors - Reflects anti-perfectionism
- Automatic today's date - Supports daily reset philosophy
- TypeScript strict mode - User's tech stack preference

All non-functional requirements are appropriate:
- Sub-2-second response time - Supports speed philosophy
- 80% test coverage - Balances quality with anti-perfectionism
- Graceful error handling - Supports judgment-free UX

**PASS**

---

**Out of Scope:**
The spec correctly excludes features not requested for Phase 1:
- Basic Foods library (Phase 2)
- Educational curriculum access (Phase 3)
- Weekly summaries (Phase 4)
- Voice optimization (Phase 4)
- NPM publishing (Phase 5)

All exclusions match the user's approval of "first build/project init" scope.

**PASS**

---

**Reusability Notes:**
The spec correctly identifies this as a greenfield project and lists external dependencies to leverage:
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (official MCP infrastructure)
- Zod (industry-standard validation)
- Node.js native fetch API (avoiding additional dependencies)

No existing codebase to reuse, so reusability analysis is N/A.

**PASS**

---

### Check 6: Task List Detailed Validation

**Test Writing Limits:**

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - CONFLICTS WITH USER STANDARDS**

The tasks.md file specifies a test-heavy approach that CONTRADICTS the user's testing standards:

**User's Testing Standards (from /agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md):**
- "Write Minimal Tests During Development"
- "Do NOT write tests for every change or intermediate step"
- "Test Only Core User Flows"
- "Defer Edge Case Testing"

**What Tasks.md Specifies:**
- TASK-013: "Unit tests written for date utilities (2-5 tests)"
- TASK-022: "2-5 focused tests for API client core functionality"
- TASK-029, 031, 033, 035, 037: Unit tests for EVERY tool (2-5 tests each = 10-25 tool tests)
- TASK-038-041: Additional integration and error handling tests (15-20 more tests)
- Total: 27-50 tests specified
- Test coverage target: 80%+

**The Conflict:**
The spec and tasks are following traditional comprehensive testing practices, but the user's standards explicitly say to "Write Minimal Tests During Development" and "Test Only Core User Flows." The task breakdown has api-engineer writing unit tests alongside implementation, which conflicts with "Do NOT write tests for every change."

**Expected Approach per User Standards:**
- api-engineer writes code with minimal/no tests during development
- testing-engineer adds strategic tests for critical paths only
- Edge cases and comprehensive coverage deferred unless business-critical
- Total test count should be lower (8-15 focused tests, not 27-50)

**Recommendation:**
Revise task groups 2-6 to remove inline unit test writing. Consolidate all testing to Task Group 7 (testing-engineer) with reduced scope focusing on critical workflows only.

**STATUS: FAIL - Test writing approach conflicts with user standards**

---

**Reusability References:**

**Status:** PASS (N/A for greenfield project)

This is a greenfield project with no existing codebase. The spec and tasks correctly identify external dependencies (MCP SDK, Zod) rather than attempting to reuse non-existent internal code.

Tasks appropriately note:
- TASK-023: "Install and Configure MCP SDK" (using external library)
- TASK-011: "Create Zod Validation Schemas" (using Zod library)
- No false reusability references

**PASS**

---

**Specificity:**

**Status:** EXCELLENT - All tasks highly specific

Every task includes:
- Clear objective ("Implement X", "Create Y", "Configure Z")
- Detailed acceptance criteria (5-7 checkboxes per task)
- Specific file paths (e.g., `/home/ericreyes/github/cleanslate-mcp/src/tools/log-food.ts`)
- Effort estimates (XS, S, M, L)
- Dependencies (TASK-XXX references)
- Priority levels

Example strong task (TASK-028):
- Specific feature: "Implement log_food Tool"
- Clear deliverable: "Tool file created with proper MCP tool structure"
- Acceptance criteria: 7 specific checkboxes including schema usage, API calls, error handling
- File path specified
- Dependencies listed (TASK-026, TASK-011, TASK-020)

**PASS**

---

**Traceability:**

**Status:** EXCELLENT - All tasks trace to requirements

**Task Group 1 (Foundation):** Traces to "Project Structure & Setup" requirement
**Task Group 2 (Types):** Traces to "Type-safe TypeScript implementation" requirement
**Task Group 3 (API Client):** Traces to "CleanSlate API Integration" requirement
**Task Group 4 (MCP Server):** Traces to "MCP Server Foundation" requirement
**Task Group 5-6 (Tools):** Traces to "Core MCP Tools (Phase 1)" requirement - all 5 tools
**Task Group 7 (Testing):** Traces to "Testing" requirement (>80% coverage)
**Task Group 8 (Documentation):** Traces to "Documentation" requirement

No orphaned tasks found. Every task supports a specified requirement.

**PASS**

---

**Scope:**

**Status:** EXCELLENT - All tasks within Phase 1 scope

Verified against roadmap Phase 1 requirements:
1. MCP Server Foundation - Tasks 23-27
2. Food Logging Tool - Task 28-29
3. Today's Log Retrieval - Task 30-31
4. Entry Management - Tasks 32-35
5. Summary Tool - Tasks 36-37 (though spec says Phase 2, it's included here)

No tasks for out-of-scope features:
- No Basic Foods tasks (Phase 2)
- No curriculum tasks (Phase 3)
- No weekly summary tasks (Phase 4)
- No voice optimization tasks (Phase 4)
- No NPM publishing tasks (Phase 5 - though documentation prepared)

**PASS**

---

**Visual Alignment:**

**Status:** N/A - No visuals exist

Backend-only project with no UI components.

---

**Task Count:**

**Status:** WARNING - High task count, but justified

- Task Group 1: 7 tasks (setup)
- Task Group 2: 8 tasks (types and utilities)
- Task Group 3: 7 tasks (API client)
- Task Group 4: 5 tasks (MCP server)
- Task Group 5: 4 tasks (2 tools)
- Task Group 6: 6 tasks (3 tools)
- Task Group 7: 5 tasks (testing)
- Task Group 8: 6 tasks (documentation)
- **Total: 48 tasks**

This is higher than typical, but justified because:
1. Greenfield project requires extensive setup (7 tasks for tooling)
2. Type-safe architecture requires comprehensive type definitions (8 tasks)
3. Each of 5 tools gets dedicated implementation + test tasks (10 tool tasks)
4. Quality gates are thorough (5 testing tasks + 6 documentation tasks)

The high count reflects thoroughness rather than over-engineering. Each task is atomic and well-scoped.

**PASS with NOTE**

---

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

**Unnecessary New Components:**

**Status:** PASS - No unnecessary components

All components are necessary for a greenfield MCP server:
- MCP Server Setup - Required for MCP protocol
- CleanSlate API Client - Required for CleanSlate integration
- 5 MCP Tools - Required per specification
- Type Definitions - Required for TypeScript strict mode
- Validation Schemas - Required for input safety
- Error Classes - Required for graceful error handling

No evidence of creating components that existing libraries could provide. The spec explicitly avoids dependencies beyond the essentials (MCP SDK, Zod).

**PASS**

---

**Duplicated Logic:**

**Status:** PASS - No duplication detected

This is a greenfield project, so no risk of duplicating existing codebase logic. The spec correctly identifies where to leverage external libraries (MCP SDK for protocol handling, Zod for validation) rather than building from scratch.

**PASS**

---

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**

**Status:** PASS - Appropriate external library usage

The spec correctly identifies and leverages:
1. @modelcontextprotocol/sdk - Official MCP infrastructure (not building from scratch)
2. Zod - Industry standard validation (not building custom validator)
3. Node.js native fetch - Using built-in HTTP client (not adding axios unless needed)

No missed opportunities for reusing existing libraries or patterns.

**PASS**

---

**Justification for New Code:**

**Status:** PASS - All new code justified

Every new component has clear justification:
- API Client - Wraps CleanSlate API with auth and error handling
- MCP Tools - Expose CleanSlate functionality via MCP protocol
- Type Definitions - Ensure type safety across boundaries
- Validation - Protect against invalid inputs
- Error Classes - Maintain judgment-free messaging philosophy

No "nice to have" features or premature abstractions detected.

**PASS**

---

## Alignment with User Standards & Preferences

### Global Standards Compliance

**Tech Stack Alignment:**
- PASS - Uses TypeScript, Node.js, pnpm as specified in tech-stack.md
- PASS - Uses Vitest for testing (modern, fast framework)
- PASS - Uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality

**Coding Style Alignment:**
- PASS - Emphasizes meaningful names, small functions, DRY principle
- PASS - Configures automated formatting (Prettier)
- PASS - Specifies TypeScript strict mode for consistency

**CRITICAL: Testing Standards Conflict:**
- FAIL - Tasks specify comprehensive unit test writing during development
- User standard: "Write Minimal Tests During Development"
- User standard: "Do NOT write tests for every change or intermediate step"
- Tasks violate: TASK-013, 022, 029, 031, 033, 035, 037 all include unit test writing
- Expected: api-engineer implements features, testing-engineer adds strategic tests afterward

**Verdict:** Strong alignment with global standards, but testing approach conflicts with user preferences.

---

## Critical Issues

### ISSUE VER-001: Test Writing Approach Conflicts with User Standards

**Severity:** Major
**Category:** Testing / Tasks
**Description:** The task breakdown specifies writing unit tests alongside feature implementation (Tasks 013, 022, 029, 031, 033, 035, 037), which contradicts the user's testing standards that explicitly state "Write Minimal Tests During Development" and "Do NOT write tests for every change or intermediate step."

**Impact:**
1. api-engineer will write 15-25 unit tests during implementation (violates minimal testing principle)
2. Total test count will be 27-50 tests (excessive per user standards)
3. Development time inflated by test writing during implementation
4. Does not follow user's preferred workflow: implement first, test critical paths later

**Recommendation:**
1. Remove inline unit test writing from Task Groups 2-6
2. Eliminate test-specific tasks: TASK-013 (date utils tests), TASK-022 (API client tests), TASK-029/031/033/035/037 (tool tests)
3. Consolidate all testing to Task Group 7 with reduced scope
4. Revise TASK-038-042 to focus on 8-15 critical workflow tests only
5. Change test coverage target from 80% to "critical paths covered"
6. Update spec.md Testing Strategy section to align with user standards

**Location:**
- tasks.md: Task Groups 2-6 (inline test tasks)
- spec.md: Lines 193-213, 694-747 (Testing Strategy section)

---

## Minor Issues

### ISSUE VER-002: Today's Summary Tool Scope Ambiguity

**Severity:** Minor
**Category:** Requirements / Scope
**Description:** The roadmap places `get_today_summary` in Phase 2, but the spec and tasks include it in Phase 1. User approved "first build/project init" which suggests Phase 1 scope.

**Impact:** Minimal - The tool is simple (S-sized) and logical to include with other CRUD operations. Including it improves Phase 1 completeness.

**Recommendation:** Accept as-is. The tool completes the basic CRUD suite and adds minimal effort. Clarify in documentation that Phase 1 includes basic summary functionality.

**Location:**
- roadmap.md: Line 19 (lists summary in Phase 2)
- spec.md: Lines 382-412 (includes tool in Phase 1)
- tasks.md: Lines 894-939 (TASK-036-037 implement in Phase 1)

---

### ISSUE VER-003: CleanSlate API Research Dependency

**Severity:** Minor
**Category:** Technical / Risk
**Description:** TASK-016 "Research CleanSlate API Documentation" is marked as M (2-4 hours) but is a critical path blocker. If the API differs significantly from assumptions, it could require spec revisions.

**Impact:** Low probability but high impact if API endpoints, authentication, or data formats differ from specification assumptions.

**Recommendation:**
1. Prioritize TASK-016 as first implementation step
2. Plan for potential spec adjustments if API differs
3. Consider reaching out to CleanSlate for API documentation before implementation begins
4. Flag as high risk in task dependencies

**Location:**
- tasks.md: Lines 394-413 (TASK-016)
- spec.md: Lines 154-183 (API Integration section with assumed endpoints)

---

### ISSUE VER-004: Manual Testing Task Vagueness

**Severity:** Minor
**Category:** Tasks
**Description:** TASK-046 "Manual Integration Test with Claude Code" has subjective acceptance criteria like "Verify all error messages are judgment-free and helpful" without concrete examples or checklist.

**Impact:** Testing consistency and completeness may vary. Judgment-free verification is subjective.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add specific error scenarios to test (invalid API key, network timeout, malformed input)
2. Create error message checklist based on spec examples
3. Define "judgment-free" criteria (no blame words, suggest recovery, maintain encouraging tone)

**Location:**
- tasks.md: Lines 1149-1171 (TASK-046)

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes (Must Address Before Implementation)

1. **Revise Test Writing Approach (VER-001)**
   - Remove inline unit test tasks from Task Groups 2-6
   - Consolidate testing to Task Group 7 with minimal critical path focus
   - Reduce total test count to 8-15 strategic tests
   - Update spec Testing Strategy to align with user standards
   - Change 80% coverage target to "critical paths covered"

### Medium Priority Improvements (Should Address)

2. **Clarify API Research as Critical Path (VER-003)**
   - Move TASK-016 to highest priority in execution order
   - Add note about potential spec adjustments if API differs
   - Consider pre-implementation API documentation review

3. **Enhance Manual Testing Task (VER-004)**
   - Add specific error scenarios to TASK-046
   - Create judgment-free messaging checklist
   - Define clear pass/fail criteria

### Low Priority Enhancements (Nice to Have)

4. **Document Phase 1 Scope Variance (VER-002)**
   - Add note explaining why get_today_summary moved to Phase 1
   - Update roadmap.md or add clarification to spec

5. **Add Dependency Vulnerability Checking**
   - Consider adding task for dependency security auditing
   - Add pnpm audit to testing workflow

6. **Consider Pre-Commit Hooks**
   - Add task for setting up git pre-commit hooks (lint, format, typecheck)
   - Ensures code quality before commits

## Conclusion

### Is the spec ready for implementation?
**YES, with one critical revision required.**

The specification is comprehensive, technically sound, and philosophically aligned with CleanSlate's anti-perfectionism values. The architecture is appropriate for an MCP server, type definitions are thorough, and error handling maintains judgment-free messaging throughout.

**However**, the test writing approach in tasks.md conflicts with the user's testing standards and must be revised before implementation begins. The current approach specifies writing 27-50 tests with unit tests alongside implementation, while the user's standards call for minimal testing during development with strategic tests added afterward by testing-engineer.

### Are the tasks actionable and complete?
**YES**, tasks are highly detailed and actionable with clear acceptance criteria, file paths, dependencies, and effort estimates. The 48-task breakdown is thorough and logical, though the test-related tasks need revision per VER-001.

### Any blockers or risks to highlight?

**Blockers:**
1. **Test writing approach conflict (VER-001)** - Must be resolved before implementation

**Risks:**
1. **CleanSlate API documentation unknown (VER-003)** - Could require spec adjustments
2. **MCP SDK learning curve** - First-time usage may take longer than estimated
3. **Authentication mechanism uncertainty** - Assumed Bearer token may differ

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Address VER-001 by revising test tasks
2. Complete TASK-016 (API research) as first priority
3. Allocate buffer time for MCP SDK learning in Task Groups 4-6
4. Plan for potential spec adjustments based on actual API

### Overall Assessment

**Score: 92/100**

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional requirements accuracy (captures all user intent)
- Strong philosophical alignment with CleanSlate values
- Thorough technical architecture and type safety
- Comprehensive task breakdown with clear dependencies
- Excellent traceability from requirements to tasks
- Appropriate scope for Phase 1 (greenfield foundation)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Test writing approach needs alignment with user standards (-5 points)
- Minor scope ambiguity on get_today_summary placement (-1 point)
- API research risk needs mitigation planning (-1 point)
- Manual testing task needs more concrete criteria (-1 point)

**Final Recommendation:** Revise test writing approach per VER-001, then proceed with implementation. The specification and tasks are otherwise excellent and ready for execution.

## Appendix: Test Writing Revision Proposal

### Current Approach (To Remove)
- TASK-013: Date utility unit tests (2-5 tests)
- TASK-022: API client unit tests (2-5 tests)
- TASK-029: log_food unit tests (2-5 tests)
- TASK-031: get_today_log unit tests (2-5 tests)
- TASK-033: delete_food_entry unit tests (2-5 tests)
- TASK-035: edit_food_entry unit tests (2-5 tests)
- TASK-037: get_today_summary unit tests (2-5 tests)
- Total inline tests: 14-35 tests

### Proposed Revised Approach (User Standards Compliant)

**Task Group 2-6: Remove all inline test tasks**
- api-engineer implements features WITHOUT writing tests
- Focus on functionality, type safety, and error handling
- Trust TypeScript strict mode and Zod validation

**Task Group 7: Revised Testing Strategy**
- TASK-038: Review code for critical paths (no test writing)
- TASK-039: Write 3-5 integration tests for MCP protocol (critical path)
- TASK-040: Write 4-6 E2E workflow tests (user journeys)
- TASK-041: Write 2-4 error handling tests (authentication, network failures)
- TASK-042: Remove coverage target, verify critical paths tested

**Total Tests:** 9-15 strategic tests (vs. 27-50 comprehensive tests)

**Revised Coverage Target:** "Critical user workflows covered" (vs. 80%+ line coverage)

**Alignment with User Standards:**
- "Write Minimal Tests During Development" - api-engineer writes zero tests
- "Test Only Core User Flows" - testing-engineer focuses on workflows
- "Defer Edge Case Testing" - Only authentication and network errors tested

**Estimated Time Savings:** 6-10 hours removed from implementation phase
